# glacier-modeling

This repository contains scripts for growing model glaciers in 1D, accounting for variable valley width, with a given mass balance and ELA driven by a randomized, scaled curve analgous to the delta18O curve. 

Other MATLAB (.m) scripts can be found in my other repo: geoscience-modeling.m
